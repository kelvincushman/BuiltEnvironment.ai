## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Services won't start
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Docker daemon
sudo systemctl status docker

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs

# Rebuild images
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### Issue: Port conflicts
**Solution:**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
sudo lsof -i :8001

# Kill the process or change port in docker-compose.yml
# Then restart: docker-compose restart
```

### Issue: Database connection errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps postgres

# Check logs
docker-compose logs postgres

# Try manual connection
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d builtenvironment

# If needed, recreate database
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

### Issue: AI not responding
**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify API keys are set
docker-compose exec backend env | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker-compose exec backend env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY

# Check for API errors in logs
docker-compose logs backend | grep -i "anthropic\|openai"

# Test API key manually
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022","max_tokens":100,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}]}'
```
