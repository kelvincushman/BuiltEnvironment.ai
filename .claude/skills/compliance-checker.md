- All requirements met
- Complete documentation
- No issues identified

ðŸŸ¡ **AMBER (75-94%)**: Partial compliance
- Minor issues or clarifications needed
- Information partially complete
- Requires verification

- Critical requirements not met
- Missing essential information
- Major issues identified

### 5. Cross-Discipline Validation
Check for conflicts between:

- Regulatory references
- Corrective actions required
- Priority ranking
- Estimated impact

## Usage:

Invoke this skill when:
- Documents need compliance validation
- Traffic light status is required
- Regulatory review is needed
- Pre-submission checks are performed
- Quality assurance review is conducted
