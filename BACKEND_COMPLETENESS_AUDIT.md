## ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing or Incomplete Components

### Authentication & Security
- [ ] **Email verification** (users register but never verify email)
- [ ] **Password reset flow** (forgot password endpoint)
- [ ] **Refresh token rotation** (tokens configured but no refresh endpoint)
- [ ] **API rate limiting** (no protection against abuse)
- [ ] **RBAC enforcement** (roles exist but not enforced in endpoints)
- [ ] **Session management** (track active sessions, logout all devices)

### Middleware
- [ ] **Request rate limiting middleware** (prevent API abuse)
- [ ] **Request size limiting middleware** (beyond file upload limits)
- [ ] **IP whitelisting/blacklisting** (security for webhooks)
- [ ] **Request ID tracking** (correlation IDs for debugging)
- [ ] **Performance monitoring middleware** (response times, slow queries)

### Services
- [ ] **Email service** (password reset, verification, notifications)
- [ ] **Notification service** (in-app notifications for AI analysis complete)
- [ ] **Background job queue** (Celery or similar for long-running tasks)
- [ ] **Caching layer** (Redis integration for frequently accessed data)
- [ ] **File storage abstraction** (S3 support, currently only local)
- [ ] **Webhook retry logic** (Stripe webhooks might fail, need retry)

### API Endpoints
- [ ] **User profile management** (`/users/me`, `/users/me/password`)
- [ ] **Team management** (`/users`, `/users/invite`, user roles per tenant)
- [ ] **Email verification** (`/auth/verify-email`)
- [ ] **Password reset** (`/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password`)
- [ ] **Token refresh** (`/auth/refresh`)
- [ ] **Document analysis trigger** (manually trigger AI analysis for document)
- [ ] **Compliance reports** (`/projects/{id}/compliance-report`)
- [ ] **Document comparison** (compare multiple documents for consistency)
- [ ] **Notification endpoints** (`/notifications`)

### Validation & Error Handling
- [ ] **Global exception handler** (consistent error responses)
- [ ] **Request validation errors** (better error messages for Pydantic)
- [ ] **Custom exception classes** (domain-specific errors)
- [ ] **Error logging to external service** (Sentry, CloudWatch)

### Testing
- [ ] **Unit tests** (services, utilities)
- [ ] **Integration tests** (API endpoints)
- [ ] **E2E tests** (full user flows)
- [ ] **Load tests** (performance under scale)

### Documentation
- [ ] **OpenAPI/Swagger docs** (FastAPI auto-generates, but needs customization)
- [ ] **API documentation** (usage examples, authentication guide)
- [ ] **Developer setup guide** (beyond QUICKSTART.md)
- [ ] **Deployment documentation** (production checklist)

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Health check endpoint enhancement** (check DB, Redis, ChromaDB connections)
- [ ] **Metrics endpoint** (Prometheus format)
- [ ] **Logging configuration** (structured logging, log levels)
- [ ] **APM integration** (Application Performance Monitoring)

### Data Management
- [ ] **Database backup strategy** (automated backups)
- [ ] **Data export for GDPR** (user data export endpoint)
- [ ] **Data deletion for GDPR** (right to be forgotten)
- [ ] **Database seeding** (demo data for testing)

### Specialist Agents
- [x] General compliance agent (implemented)
- [x] Structural engineering agent (implemented)
- [x] Fire safety agent (implemented)
- [x] Accessibility agent (implemented)
- [ ] Building envelope agent (defined but needs system prompt)
- [ ] Mechanical services agent (defined but needs system prompt)
- [ ] Electrical services agent (defined but needs system prompt)
- [ ] Environmental & sustainability agent (defined but needs system prompt)
- [ ] Health & safety agent (defined but needs system prompt)
- [ ] Quality assurance agent (defined but needs system prompt)
- [ ] Legal & contracts agent (defined but needs system prompt)
- [ ] Specialist systems agent (defined but needs system prompt)
- [ ] External works agent (defined but needs system prompt)
- [ ] Finishes & interiors agent (defined but needs system prompt)
