# Environmental & Sustainability Agent - Langflow Workflow

## Overview

Checks compliance with **Part L (Energy Efficiency)**, **BREEAM**, **LEED**, and **Net Zero Carbon** requirements for sustainable building design.

## UK Building Regulations - Part L

### Part L1A - New Dwellings
- Target CO₂ Emission Rate (TER) vs. Dwelling Emission Rate (DER)
- Fabric Energy Efficiency (FEE) ≤ target value
- Primary Energy Rate ≤ target
- U-values, air permeability, thermal bridging
- Building services efficiency

### Part L2A - New Non-Domestic Buildings
- Target Building Emission Rate (BER) vs. TER
- Notional building comparison
- SBEM (Simplified Building Energy Model) compliance
- Energy performance certificate (EPC) rating

### Part L - 2021 Uplift (Future Homes/Buildings Standard)
- 31% CO₂ reduction (dwellings), 27% reduction (non-domestic) from 2013 baseline
- Preparation for Future Homes Standard (2025) - 75-80% CO₂ reduction

## Environmental Assessment Methods

### BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method)
- **Categories**: Energy, Water, Materials, Waste, Land use, Ecology, Pollution, Health & Wellbeing, Transport, Management, Innovation
- **Ratings**: Unclassified (<30), Pass (≥30), Good (≥45), Very Good (≥55), Excellent (≥70), Outstanding (≥85)
- **Mandatory credits**: Energy performance, water consumption

### LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)
- **Categories**: Location & Transportation, Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy & Atmosphere, Materials & Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Innovation
- **Ratings**: Certified (40-49), Silver (50-59), Gold (60-79), Platinum (≥80)

### WELL Building Standard
- Focus on human health and wellness
- Air, water, nourishment, light, movement, thermal comfort, sound, materials, mind, community

### Passivhaus
- Ultra-low energy buildings
- **Criteria**: Space heating demand ≤ 15 kWh/m²/year, primary energy ≤ 120 kWh/m²/year, air permeability ≤ 0.6 ACH @ 50Pa

### Net Zero Carbon Buildings
- UKGBC Net Zero Carbon Buildings Framework
- Operational carbon (energy use) + embodied carbon (construction materials)
- Offset remaining emissions

## British Standards

- **BS EN 15978:2011** - Sustainability of construction works. Assessment of environmental performance of buildings. Calculation method
- **BS EN 15804:2012+A2:2019** - Sustainability of construction works. Environmental product declarations
- **BS 8903:2010** - Principles and framework for procuring sustainably. Guide
- **PAS 2080:2016** - Carbon management in infrastructure

## Key Compliance Checks

### Check 1: DER ≤ TER
**Requirement**: Part L1A - Dwelling Emission Rate must not exceed Target Emission Rate

### Check 2: FEE Compliance
**Requirement**: Part L1A - Fabric Energy Efficiency within target

### Check 3: Renewable Energy
**Requirement**: BREEAM/LEED - % of energy from renewable sources

### Check 4: Embodied Carbon
**Requirement**: Net Zero - Embodied carbon calculation and reduction targets

### Check 5: Water Consumption
**Requirement**: BREEAM - Water consumption targets (e.g., ≤ 105 l/person/day for dwellings)
