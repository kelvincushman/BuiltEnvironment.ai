- Building metadata (height, occupancy, construction type)
- Tenant_id for multi-tenant isolation

**Specialist Agents Executed:**
1. **Structural Agent** â†’ Part A, Eurocodes (structural drawings, calculations)

- **M&E vs. Structural**: Service penetrations through fire-rated floors
- **Building Envelope vs. Fire Safety**: External wall insulation combustibility
- **Electrical vs. Plumbing**: Services clash detection

**Conflict Detection Logic:**
```python
if structural_agent.beam_depth > architectural_agent.ceiling_height:
    conflict = {
        "type": "structural_architectural_clash",
        "severity": "high",
        "description": "Beam depth exceeds available ceiling height",
        "agents_involved": ["structural", "architectural"],
        "recommendation": "Reduce beam depth or increase floor-to-floor height"
    }
```

**Outputs:**
- List of cross-discipline conflicts
- Severity ratings (low, medium, high, critical)
- Resolution recommendations

  - Part B (Fire Safety)
  - Part C (Moisture Protection)
  - Part E (Acoustics)
  - Part F-J (Building Services)
  - Part L (Energy)

  document.compliance_findings = {...}  # Traffic light results
  document.status = DocumentStatus.AI_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE
  ```
- Send webhook to FastAPI:
  ```
  POST /api/v1/langflow/webhook/results
  {
    "document_id": "uuid",
    "overall_status": "amber",
    "findings": [...]
  }
  ```

**Outputs:**
- Database record updated
- Webhook response sent
- User notification triggered

---

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Processing
- All specialist agents execute in parallel (not sequential)
- Typical processing time: 8-15 seconds for full document analysis

### Caching
- Regulation knowledge base cached (Parts A-P requirements)
- Document classification models cached
- Frequently used calculations cached (U-values, fire resistance)

### Load Balancing
- Distribute agent workload across multiple Langflow instances
- Queue management for high-volume periods

---

## Error Handling

### Agent Failure Recovery
- If one specialist agent fails, continue with others
- Mark failed agent findings as "requires_manual_review"
- Log error for investigation

### Timeout Handling
- Agent timeout: 30 seconds per agent
- Overall workflow timeout: 2 minutes
- Return partial results if timeout occurs

---

## Testing the Master Orchestration

### Test Document 1: Simple Fire Strategy
**Expected**: Fire Safety agent only
**Processing time**: ~5 seconds

### Test Document 2: Full Architectural GA Drawing
**Expected**: All 13 agents invoked
**Processing time**: ~12 seconds

### Test Document 3: Structural Calculations
**Expected**: Structural agent + Building Envelope agent
**Processing time**: ~6 seconds

## References

All specialist agents must be created and configured before the master orchestration workflow can function. See individual agent READMEs for detailed requirements.
