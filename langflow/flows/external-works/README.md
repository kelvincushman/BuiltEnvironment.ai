# External Works Agent - Langflow Workflow

## Overview

Checks compliance for external works including drainage, landscaping, highways, sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), and site infrastructure.

## Drainage

### Part H - Drainage and Waste Disposal
(See mechanical-services agent for detailed Part H requirements)

### Sewers for Adoption (7th Edition) - WRc / Water UK
- Design standards for sewers to be adopted by water companies
- Pipe materials, sizes, gradients, bedding
- Inspection chambers, manholes
- Surface water and foul water separation

### BS EN 752:2017 - Drain and Sewer Systems Outside Buildings
- Sewer system management
- Hydraulic design
- Structural design
- Construction and testing

### BS EN 1610:2015 - Construction and Testing of Drains and Sewers
- Installation methods
- Pipe bedding and backfilling
- Testing (water test, air test, CCTV survey)

## Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)

### SuDS Hierarchy
1. **Infiltration** - Soakaways, infiltration basins, permeable paving
2. **Attenuation** - Detention basins, underground storage tanks
3. **Discharge to watercourse** - Swales, ponds
4. **Discharge to sewer** - Last resort, flow control required

### CIRIA C753 - The SuDS Manual (2015)
- SuDS design principles
- Water quantity management (flood risk)
- Water quality treatment (pollutant removal)
- Amenity and biodiversity benefits

### Design Requirements
- **Greenfield runoff rate** - Discharge limited to 1-year, 30-year, 100-year greenfield rates
- **Storage volume** - 1:100 year + 40% climate change allowance
- **Treatment train** - Multiple SuDS components for water quality
- **Adoption and maintenance** - SuDS Approval Body (SAB) in Wales, Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) in England

### SuDS Components
- **Permeable paving** - Porous asphalt, permeable block paving
- **Swales** - Vegetated channels for conveyance and infiltration
- **Detention basins** - Temporary storage, release at controlled rate
- **Infiltration basins** - Permanent infiltration to ground
- **Green roofs** - Vegetated roofs for attenuation

### BS 8582:2013 - Code of Practice for Surface Water Management for Development Sites
- Surface water drainage strategy
- SuDS selection and design
- Maintenance and adoption

## Highways and Roads

### Manual for Streets (2007) and Manual for Streets 2 (2010)
- Residential street design
- Vehicle tracking and swept paths
- Pedestrian and cycle facilities
- Speed management
- Parking provision

### Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB)
- Trunk road and motorway design standards
- Geometric design
- Pavement design
- Highway structures

### BS 7533 series - Pavements Constructed with Clay, Natural Stone or Concrete Pavers
- **BS 7533-1** - Guide for the structural design of heavy duty pavements constructed of clay pavers or natural stone
- **BS 7533-3** - Code of practice for laying precast concrete paving blocks and clay pavers for flexible pavements
- **BS 7533-13** - Guide for the design of permeable pavements constructed with concrete paving blocks and flags, natural stone slabs and setts and clay pavers

### Section 38 / Section 278 Agreements (Highways Act 1980)
- **Section 38** - Agreement for adoption of new residential roads by Highways Authority
- **Section 278** - Agreement for highway improvements/alterations

**Requirements:**
- Bond or commuted sum for maintenance
- Construction to adoptable standards
- Inspection and approval by Highways Authority

## Landscaping

### BS 3882:2015 - Specification for Topsoil
- Topsoil quality for planting
- Nutrient content, pH, contamination

### BS 3998:2010 - Tree Work. Recommendations
- Tree surgery and management
- Pruning, felling, crown reduction

### BS 8545:2014 - Trees: From Nursery to Independence in the Landscape. Recommendations
- Tree pit design and specification
- Soil volumes for healthy tree growth
- Irrigation and mulching

### BS 5837:2012 - Trees in Relation to Design, Demolition and Construction. Recommendations
- Tree surveys and impact assessment
- Root protection areas (RPA)
- Tree protection during construction

### Ecology and Biodiversity
- Ecological surveys (protected species)
- Biodiversity net gain (10% minimum from 2024)
- Habitat creation and enhancement

## Site Infrastructure

### Utilities
- Electricity substations and distribution
- Gas governor stations and mains
- Water mains and meters
- Telecoms infrastructure

### Street Lighting
- **BS 5489 series** - Code of practice for the design of road lighting
- **BS EN 13201 series** - Road lighting
- Lighting classes and illuminance levels
- Energy efficiency (LED)

### Boundaries and Fencing
- **BS 1722 series** - Fences
- Retaining walls design (BS 8002, Eurocode 7)

## British Standards

- **BS 4428:1989** - Code of practice for general landscape operations (excluding hard surfaces)
- **BS 8204-2:2003** - Screeds, bases and in-situ floorings. Concrete wearing surfaces. Code of practice
- **BS 7263 series** - Precast concrete flags, kerbs, channels, edgings and quadrants

## Example Compliance Checks

### Check 1: SuDS Greenfield Runoff Rate
**Requirement**: CIRIA C753 - Discharge limited to 1-year greenfield runoff rate (typically 2-5 l/s/ha)

### Check 2: Drainage Pipe Gradient
**Requirement**: Sewers for Adoption - 150mm foul sewer gradient 1:80 minimum

### Check 3: Section 38 Agreement Secured
**Requirement**: Highways Act 1980 - S38 agreement in place for adoption of new roads

### Check 4: Tree Protection Measures
**Requirement**: BS 5837 - Root Protection Areas (RPA) fenced off, no construction activity within RPA
