# Document Review System - Brainstorming Session

## Core Concept

Create an intelligent document review system that acts like having multiple expert consultants reviewing documents simultaneously, with each specialist highlighting their areas of concern using a traffic light system. Think of it as "Google Docs comments" but for construction compliance, where the AI acts as multiple domain experts.

## Key Questions to Explore

### What types of documents need review?
- **Contracts & Legal Documents**: JCT contracts, professional services agreements, warranties
- **Technical Specifications**: M&E specifications, structural calculations, material specifications
- **Design Documents**: Architectural drawings, engineering drawings, BIM models
- **Compliance Documents**: Building control submissions, planning applications, fire strategies
- **Safety Documents**: Risk assessments, method statements, CDM documentation
- **Environmental Documents**: BREEAM assessments, energy calculations, sustainability reports
- **Cost Documents**: Bills of quantities, cost plans, value engineering reports

### What compliance issues should we catch?
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Building Regulations breaches, planning policy conflicts
- **Standard Deviations**: RIBA, CIBSE, BS standard non-conformance
- **Safety Risks**: CDM regulation breaches, H&S policy violations
- **Environmental Issues**: BREEAM requirement failures, energy performance gaps
- **Contract Risks**: Unfavorable terms, liability issues, payment risks
- **Technical Errors**: Calculation mistakes, specification conflicts, design coordination issues

### How should users interact with the system?
- **Document Upload**: Drag-and-drop, bulk upload, integration with existing systems
- **Review Navigation**: Click-through highlighted issues, filter by severity/type
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user review, comment system, issue assignment
- **Action Management**: Create action items, track resolution progress
- **Reporting**: Generate compliance reports, export findings, share with stakeholders
