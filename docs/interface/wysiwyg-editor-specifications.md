## Overview

The WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor is the primary user interface for reviewing, editing, and customizing AI-generated compliance reports while preserving critical compliance information and maintaining professional standards.

## EDITOR CORE FUNCTIONALITY

### Rich Text Editing Capabilities

The editor provides comprehensive text formatting options including multiple heading levels, paragraph styles, bullet points, numbered lists, and text emphasis options such as bold, italic, and underline. Users can create and modify tables for organizing compliance data, insert images and diagrams to support technical explanations, and embed hyperlinks to relevant regulations and standards. The editor supports multiple font options while maintaining professional document standards and ensures consistent formatting across all report sections.

### Compliance Preservation System

A critical feature of the editor is its ability to protect essential compliance information from accidental deletion or modification. The system automatically identifies and locks critical compliance statements, regulatory references, and mandatory recommendations while allowing users to customize presentation and add supplementary information. Protected elements are visually distinguished with special formatting and cannot be deleted without explicit confirmation, ensuring that all regulatory requirements remain intact throughout the editing process.

### Interactive Annotation Framework

The editor integrates seamlessly with the traffic light compliance system, allowing users to click on any highlighted compliance issue to view detailed explanations, regulatory references, and recommended actions. Users can expand or collapse detailed technical information, add their own comments and notes to compliance issues, and customize the level of detail displayed for different audiences. The annotation system maintains links between compliance issues and their supporting evidence, ensuring traceability throughout the editing process.

## USER INTERFACE DESIGN

### Document Layout Structure

The editor features a three-panel layout optimized for compliance document review and editing. The main editing area occupies the center panel, providing ample space for document content with clear visual hierarchy and professional formatting. The left panel contains a document outline and navigation tree, allowing users to quickly jump between different sections and compliance categories. The right panel displays contextual information including compliance details, regulatory references, and editing tools relevant to the currently selected content.

### Compliance Visualization

The editor prominently displays the traffic light compliance system throughout the document, with green indicators for fully compliant sections, amber warnings for items requiring attention, and red alerts for critical non-compliance issues. Each compliance indicator is interactive, providing detailed information when clicked and maintaining visual consistency with the overall system design. The editor includes a compliance dashboard showing overall document health, progress toward full compliance, and summary statistics for different compliance categories.

### Collaborative Features

The editor supports real-time collaborative editing with multiple team members able to work on the same document simultaneously. User contributions are tracked with color-coded highlighting and author attribution, while a comprehensive comment system allows team members to discuss specific compliance issues and recommendations. The editor includes conflict resolution tools for managing simultaneous edits and maintains a complete revision history with the ability to compare versions and revert changes when necessary.

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Editor Technology Stack

The WYSIWYG editor is built using modern web technologies including React for the user interface framework, ensuring responsive design and optimal performance across different devices and browsers. The editor core utilizes Draft.js or similar rich text editing libraries, providing robust text editing capabilities while maintaining clean HTML output. Real-time collaboration is implemented using WebSocket connections with operational transformation algorithms to handle concurrent editing conflicts seamlessly.

### Data Synchronization

All editor changes are automatically synchronized with the backend system, ensuring that user modifications are preserved and backed up continuously.

Changes are saved incrementally with conflict resolution mechanisms to handle simultaneous edits from multiple users, and the system provides offline editing capabilities with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored.

### Integration with Langflow

The editor maintains seamless integration with the Langflow processing pipeline, allowing users to trigger re-analysis of specific document sections when modifications require updated compliance checking. The integration preserves the connection between edited content and original AI analysis results, enabling users to understand the impact of their changes on overall compliance status. The system provides feedback on how user modifications affect compliance scoring and recommendations.

## COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT FEATURES

### Protected Content System

The editor implements a sophisticated content protection system that prevents users from accidentally removing or modifying critical compliance information. Protected elements include mandatory regulatory statements, required safety warnings, essential technical specifications, and legally required disclaimers. These elements are visually distinguished with special borders or background colors and require explicit confirmation before modification or deletion.

### Regulatory Reference Integration

All compliance issues in the editor are linked to their relevant regulatory sources, providing users with direct access to the underlying requirements and standards. Users can view excerpts from relevant regulations, access full regulatory documents through integrated links, and understand the specific requirements that drive each compliance recommendation. The reference system is automatically updated when regulations change, ensuring that users always have access to current requirements.

### Audit Trail Maintenance

The editor maintains a comprehensive audit trail of all changes made to compliance documents, including user identification, timestamp information, change descriptions, and justification for modifications. This audit trail is essential for demonstrating due diligence in compliance management and provides accountability for all document modifications. The system can generate audit reports showing the complete history of document changes and compliance status evolution.

## DOCUMENT EXPORT AND SHARING

### Multiple Format Support

The editor provides export capabilities to multiple professional formats including PDF for final distribution and archival, Microsoft Word for further editing in traditional office environments, HTML for web publication and sharing, and print-optimized formats for hard copy distribution. All export formats maintain compliance highlighting and regulatory references, ensuring that critical information is preserved regardless of the output format.

### Branding and Customization

Users can customize document appearance with company branding including logos, color schemes, and corporate formatting standards. The editor provides template systems for different report types and client requirements while maintaining compliance with professional presentation standards. Customization options include header and footer design, page layout preferences, and corporate style guide integration.

### Sharing and Collaboration Controls

The editor includes comprehensive sharing controls allowing users to specify access permissions for different team members and external stakeholders. Sharing options include read-only access for clients and regulatory authorities, comment-only access for reviewers, and full editing access for project team members. The system maintains security controls ensuring that sensitive compliance information is only accessible to authorized personnel.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE FEATURES
