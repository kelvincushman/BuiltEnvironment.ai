**Collaborative Editing Features**: Real-time collaborative editing with user presence indicators, conflict resolution tools, and comprehensive revision tracking. Multiple team members can work on the same document simultaneously with automatic synchronization and change highlighting.

**Format Preservation**: Advanced formatting preservation ensures that document structure, compliance highlighting, and regulatory references are maintained throughout the editing process while allowing users to customize presentation and add supplementary information.

## RAG CHAT INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS

### Intelligent Document Query System

The bottom panel features a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) powered chat interface that provides intelligent interaction with all project documents and analysis results. The system maintains real-time synchronization with document changes and updates, ensuring that chat responses always reflect the current state of project information.

**Natural Language Queries**: Users can ask questions in natural language about any aspect of their project documents, compliance requirements, or analysis results. The system understands context and provides accurate, relevant responses based on the complete project knowledge base.

**Document-Specific Context**: The chat system maintains awareness of the currently viewed document and provides contextually relevant responses that prioritize information from the active document while drawing on the broader project knowledge base when needed.

**Multi-Document Intelligence**: Users can ask questions that span multiple documents, enabling queries like "What are the conflicts between the electrical specifications and the fire safety requirements?" with comprehensive answers that reference all relevant project documents.

### RAG Database Integration

**Real-Time Knowledge Base Updates**: Every document upload, edit, or modification automatically updates the RAG database, ensuring that the chat system always has access to the most current project information. The update process maintains document relationships and cross-references for comprehensive query responses.

**Intelligent Document Chunking**: Documents are intelligently segmented into meaningful chunks that preserve context and relationships between different sections. The chunking process considers document structure, compliance requirements, and technical relationships for optimal information retrieval.

**Semantic Search Capabilities**: The RAG system uses advanced semantic search to understand the meaning and intent behind user queries, providing relevant results even when exact keywords don't match. This enables more natural and effective document interaction.

**Version-Aware Responses**: The system maintains awareness of document versions and changes, providing responses that reflect the current state of documents while maintaining access to historical information when relevant for context or comparison.

### Chat Interface Features

**Contextual Response Generation**: Chat responses include direct references to relevant document sections with clickable links that navigate users to the specific content being discussed. Responses maintain professional technical language appropriate for construction industry professionals.

**Source Attribution**: All chat responses include clear attribution to source documents with page numbers, section references, and confidence indicators. Users can verify information and access original sources with a single click for comprehensive understanding.

**Conversation History**: Complete conversation history is maintained for each project with search and filtering capabilities. Users can return to previous conversations and build on earlier discussions for continuous project knowledge development.

**Export and Sharing**: Chat conversations can be exported as formatted reports and shared with team members or clients. The export function maintains all source references and links for comprehensive documentation of project discussions and decisions.

## LANGFLOW RAG INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### Document Processing Pipeline

**Automatic Document Ingestion**: When documents are uploaded or created, they are automatically processed through the Langflow RAG pipeline with intelligent content extraction, semantic analysis, and knowledge base integration. The process maintains user ID context and project association for secure data handling.

**Content Vectorization**: Document content is converted to high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning and relationships, enabling sophisticated similarity search and contextual retrieval. The vectorization process preserves technical terminology and construction industry-specific language patterns.

**Relationship Mapping**: The system automatically identifies and maps relationships between different documents, sections, and compliance requirements. This relationship mapping enables comprehensive cross-document queries and conflict identification.

**Incremental Updates**: Document changes and edits trigger incremental updates to the RAG database, ensuring that new information is immediately available for chat queries without requiring complete reprocessing of the entire project knowledge base.

### Query Processing Workflow

**Intent Recognition**: User queries are analyzed to understand intent, scope, and required information types. The system recognizes different query patterns including factual questions, compliance checks, conflict identification, and recommendation requests.

**Contextual Retrieval**: Relevant document sections are retrieved based on semantic similarity, current document context, and user query intent. The retrieval process considers document importance, recency, and user access permissions for appropriate response generation.

**Response Synthesis**: Retrieved information is synthesized into coherent, professional responses that address user queries comprehensively while maintaining technical accuracy and regulatory compliance. Responses include appropriate caveats and recommendations for professional verification when required.

**Continuous Learning**: The system learns from user interactions and feedback to improve response quality and relevance over time. User ratings and corrections help refine the knowledge base and query processing algorithms for enhanced performance.
