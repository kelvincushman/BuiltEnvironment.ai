# BuiltEnvironment.ai System Flow Guide

## Overview

This document explains exactly how the BuiltEnvironment.ai system works from the moment a client uploads a document to the final delivery of AI-enhanced results. The system combines document processing, AI analysis, legal compliance checking, and professional engineer review into a seamless workflow.

## Complete System Flow

### Phase 1: Document Ingestion & Initial Processing

#### Step 1: Client Document Upload
**What Happens**: Client uploads construction documents through the web interface
- **Document Types**: Contracts, specifications, drawings, compliance certificates, safety reports
- **Upload Methods**: Drag-and-drop interface, bulk upload, email integration
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, Word, Excel, images (JPG, PNG), CAD files

**Behind the Scenes**:
1. Document is immediately encrypted using TLS 1.3
2. File is temporarily stored in secure, isolated processing environment
3. Document metadata is extracted (file type, size, creation date)
4. Initial virus and malware scanning is performed
5. Document is queued for AI processing

#### Step 2: Document Classification & Routing
**What Happens**: AI automatically identifies document type and routes to appropriate processing pipeline

**AI Classification Engine**:
- **Contract Documents**: Routed to legal compliance analysis
- **Technical Specifications**: Sent to design validation pipeline
- **Safety Documents**: Processed through health & safety compliance checker
- **Cost Documents**: Analyzed by cost analysis engine
- **Mixed Documents**: Split into relevant sections for multi-pipeline processing

**Processing Decision Tree**:
```
Document Upload
    ├── Legal Document? → Legal Compliance Pipeline
    ├── Technical Drawing? → Design Validation Pipeline
    ├── Safety Document? → H&S Compliance Pipeline
    ├── Cost Document? → Cost Analysis Pipeline
    └── Mixed Document? → Multi-Pipeline Processing
```

### Phase 2: AI Analysis & Processing
