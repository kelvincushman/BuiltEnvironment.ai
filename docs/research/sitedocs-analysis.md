## Digital Forms Deep Dive

### Core Digital Forms Capabilities

**Elimination of Paper Processes**: SiteDocs completely replaces traditional paper-based forms with digital alternatives. All safety documents are accessible through workers' mobile devices, eliminating the need to print, photocopy, and physically deliver forms to job sites.

**Instant Availability and Access**: Workers gain immediate access to safety resources including Safety Manuals, Safety Data Sheets (SDS), Safe Work Practices, and other critical documentation through their mobile devices.

**Automatic Data Capture**: Once forms are completed and signed on mobile devices, they are automatically time and location stamped, saved to the account, and made available at head office. This eliminates issues with damaged, lost, or forgotten forms.

**Offline Functionality**: The platform continues to function without internet connectivity, with forms saved locally on devices and automatically uploaded when connection is restored. This addresses the connectivity challenges common in construction environments.

### Advanced Form Features

**Role-Based Form Assignment**: Workers only see forms and safety resources specific to their location or project, reducing confusion and ensuring relevant information is prioritized.

**Daily Task Management**: Each morning, workers can view overdue items and upcoming assignments through a personalized to-do list interface.

**Rich Data Capture**: Forms support detailed information capture including photo annotations, voice recordings, checkboxes, and digital signatures, providing safety managers with comprehensive and timely insights.

**Automated Scheduling**: Forms, toolbox talks, hazard inspections, and other safety activities can be scheduled by date and set to automatically repeat, reducing administrative workload.

**Signature Workflows**: Supervisors can be scheduled to review and approve forms with automated reminders to ensure timely completion and sign-off.

**Intelligent Notifications**: The system automatically reminds workers to complete assigned forms and notifies management of incidents or compliance issues through in-app chat functionality.

### Analytics and Insights

**Advanced Analytics**: SiteDocs Analytics identifies trends, discovers insights, and automatically tracks critical KPIs. The system provides smart suggestions for data visualization, drill-down paths, and even explains charts through written text.

**Real-Time Compliance Monitoring**: The platform provides immediate visibility into compliance status across projects and locations, enabling proactive management of safety requirements.

### Customer Success Stories

**Jakes Construction**: Reported saving over $100,000 in the first year through reduced administrative time, paperwork, personnel, and training processes, with minimal crew resistance to adoption.

**Lafarge**: Transformed complex paper-based Field Level Risk Assessments (FLRA) from "monster" documents with ten folds into streamlined digital processes, saving hours and sometimes weeks of processing time.

**Clyde Companies**: Used SiteDocs dashboards to identify their most common injury type and time patterns, resulting in a 22.5% decrease in that specific injury category across all workers.
