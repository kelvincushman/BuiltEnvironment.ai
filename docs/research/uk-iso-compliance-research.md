## Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 (CDM 2015)

The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 came into force in Great Britain on 6 April 2015 and represent the primary health and safety legislation for construction projects in the UK.

### CDM 2015 Structure

CDM 2015 is divided into five parts:

**Part 1 - Application and Definitions**: Establishes the scope of the regulations and key definitions for construction work and duty holders.

**Part 2 - Client Duties**: Covers the duties of clients for all construction projects. These duties apply in full for commercial clients, while duties for domestic clients normally pass to other duty holders.

**Part 3 - Duty Holder Responsibilities**: Covers the health and safety duties and roles of:
- **Designers**: Responsible for eliminating, reducing, and controlling foreseeable risks during design
- **Principal Designers**: Coordinate health and safety aspects of the design work and prepare pre-construction information
- **Principal Contractors**: Plan, manage, and coordinate health and safety during the construction phase
