### Information Sharing Protocol
Each AI agent shares relevant findings with other agents to ensure comprehensive compliance checking. For example, the Fire Safety Agent alerts the Finishes Agent about fire-rated material requirements, while the Structural Agent coordinates with the Building Envelope Agent on thermal bridge details.

### Conflict Resolution
When agents identify conflicting requirements between different disciplines, the system flags these for professional engineer review and resolution, ensuring all compliance requirements are met without compromise.

### Continuous Learning
All agents continuously update their knowledge bases as regulations change, new standards are published, and industry best practices evolve, ensuring current and accurate compliance checking.

This specialized agent structure ensures comprehensive coverage of all building disciplines while maintaining deep expertise in each specific area of construction and compliance.
