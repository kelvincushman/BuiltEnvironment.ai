# Document Review System - Visual UI/UX Specifications

## Overview

The BuiltEnvironment.ai Document Review System provides an interactive, visual interface for reviewing construction documents with real-time compliance assessment using a traffic light system. The system highlights non-conforming areas and potential issues against relevant technical guidelines including RIBA, CIBSE, BREEAM, and UK Building Regulations.

## Core Features

### Traffic Light Compliance System

The system uses a three-tier traffic light approach to indicate compliance status:

**ðŸŸ¢ Green (Compliant)**
- Full compliance with all relevant standards
- No issues identified
- Best practice implementation confirmed
- Ready for approval/sign-off

**ðŸŸ¡ Amber (Attention Required)**
- Minor non-compliance issues identified
- Recommendations for improvement available
- Potential future compliance risks
- Review and consideration recommended

**ðŸ”´ Red (Non-Compliant)**
- Significant compliance failures detected
- Regulatory breach risk identified
- Immediate action required
- Cannot proceed without resolution

### Document Annotation System

**Inline Highlighting**: Text and sections are highlighted with color-coded overlays corresponding to compliance status.

**Sidebar Comments**: Detailed explanations appear in a collapsible sidebar, showing specific regulation references and recommended actions.

**Popup Tooltips**: Hover over highlighted areas to see quick compliance summaries and regulation references.

**Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bars show overall document compliance percentage and section-by-section status.
