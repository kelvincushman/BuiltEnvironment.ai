# Human-in-the-Loop: Professional Engineer Validation Model

## Overview

This document defines the **engineer-led review process** that ensures complete trust in AI-generated compliance findings. The AI does the heavy lifting, but **human professional engineers validate** before final sign-off, ensuring professional accountability and liability protection.

---

## The Critical Principle

> **"AI Precision, Human Accountability"**

**AI agents analyze** → **Human engineers validate** → **Professional sign-off**

### Why This is Non-Negotiable:

1. **Professional Liability**: Building Control requires professional engineer sign-off
2. **Legal Responsibility**: Someone must be accountable for compliance statements
3. **Insurance Requirements**: Professional indemnity insurance requires human oversight
4. **User Trust**: Engineers won't rely on "black box" AI without validation
5. **Regulatory Acceptance**: Building Control officers need professional engineer stamp

---

## Three-Tier Validation Model

### Tier 1: AI Analysis (Automated) 🤖

**What the AI Does**:

- Cites sources for every finding

**Output**:
- Preliminary compliance report
- Traffic light dashboard
- Detailed findings with references
- Flagged items for human review
- Confidence scores

**Status**: "AI Analysis Complete - Awaiting Engineer Review"

### Tier 2: User Review (Self-Serve Platform) 👤

**What the User Does**:
- Reviews AI findings

**Status**: "Under User Review"

### Tier 3: Professional Engineer Validation (Critical) ✅

**What the Chartered Engineer Does**:
- Reviews ALL AI findings
- Validates traffic light assignments
- Checks critical compliance items
- Verifies calculations and assumptions
- Approves or rejects findings
- Provides professional sign-off

**Output**:
- **Validated Compliance Report**
- **Professional Engineer Stamp**

## Validation Workflow (Detailed)

### Step 1: AI Analysis

```
User uploads: "MEP_Specifications_Rev_C.pdf"
↓
AI Agents analyze (13 agents in parallel):
- Mechanical Agent: Checks HVAC, ventilation (Part F)
- Electrical Agent: Checks BS 7671, Part P
- Fire Safety Agent: Checks Part B, BS 9999
- [... all 13 agents ...]
↓
AI generates findings:
- 🟢 45 items compliant (95%+ confidence)
- 🟡 12 items need clarification (75-95% confidence)
- 🔴 3 items non-compliant (<75% confidence)
↓
Status: "AI Analysis Complete"
```

### Step 2: User Review

```
User reviews dashboard:
- Sees traffic light summary
- Reads detailed findings
- Checks sources and citations
- Adds context: "Item 7 - discussed with architect, approved deviation"
- Flags for expert: "Item 12 - need structural engineer opinion"
↓
User actions:
- Accept AI findings: 40 items
- Add comments: 10 items
- Request expert review: 10 items
↓
Status: "User Review Complete - Ready for Validation"
```

### Step 3: Engineer Validation Request

```
User clicks: "Request Professional Engineer Validation"
↓
Platform routes to appropriate engineer:
- Structural items → Chartered Structural Engineer
- Fire safety items → Fire Safety Specialist
- Electrical items → Chartered Electrical Engineer
- [... matched by discipline ...]
↓
Engineer receives:
- Original document
- AI findings report
- User comments and context
- Items flagged for review
↓
Status: "Assigned to Engineer: John Smith CEng MCIBSE"
```

### Step 4: Engineer Review

```
Engineer (John Smith CEng MCIBSE) reviews:

🟢 Green items (45):
- Spot-check 10% (5 items) - validates AI accuracy
- Result: All correct ✓

🟡 Amber items (12):
- Reviews each item in detail
- Cross-references with source document
- Validates or changes traffic light
- Example: Item 7 - agrees with user, changes to 🟢
- Example: Item 12 - identifies issue, changes to 🔴

🔴 Red items (3):
- Deep analysis required
- Reviews calculations
- Checks regulation interpretation
- Confirms non-compliance
- Provides corrective action recommendation

↓
Engineer actions:
- Validates: 50 items
- Modified: 5 items (changed traffic light)
- Rejected: 2 items (AI incorrect)
- Added: 3 items (AI missed)
↓
Status: "Engineer Review Complete"
```

### Step 5: Professional Sign-Off

```

## Confidence-Based Routing

### Automatic Expert Escalation

AI automatically flags items for human review based on:

**Low Confidence (<75%)**:
- Requires mandatory engineer review
- Cannot be self-certified

**Medium Confidence (75-95%)**:
- User can self-certify for low-risk items
- Engineer review recommended for Building Control submissions

**High Confidence (>95%)**:
- User can rely on AI finding
- Engineer spot-check sufficient

**Complex Items**:
- Calculations (always require engineer validation)
- Deviations from standards
- Performance-based compliance
- Novel materials or systems

### Example Routing Logic:

```python
def route_for_validation(finding):
    if finding.confidence < 0.75:
        return "MANDATORY_ENGINEER_REVIEW"

    elif finding.confidence < 0.95:
        if finding.is_calculation:
            return "ENGINEER_REVIEW_RECOMMENDED"
        elif user.subscription == "Enterprise":
            return "USER_DISCRETION"
        else:
            return "ENGINEER_REVIEW_RECOMMENDED"

    else:  # High confidence (>95%)
        if finding.is_life_safety:
            return "ENGINEER_SPOT_CHECK"
        else:
            return "USER_CAN_SELF_CERTIFY"
```
