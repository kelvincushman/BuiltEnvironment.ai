# Built Environment Legal Assistant: System Architecture

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the proposed system architecture for a legal assistant designed for companies operating in the built environment. The system will provide intuitive document scanning, analysis, and workflow management features, leveraging modern AI technologies to address the specific legal needs of the construction, engineering, and real estate sectors. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and adaptable, using Langflow for workflow orchestration and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent document processing.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

The proposed architecture is a multi-layered system that integrates document intake, processing, analysis, and user interaction into a seamless workflow. The core components of the system are:

*   **User Interface (UI)**: An intuitive web-based interface for document submission, analysis review, and workflow management.
*   **Document Intake and OCR Layer**: Handles the ingestion of various document formats and converts them into machine-readable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
*   **AI Processing and RAG Layer**: The core of the system, where documents are analyzed, indexed, and queried using a RAG-based approach. This layer leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language understanding and generation.
*   **Workflow Orchestration Layer**: Powered by Langflow, this layer manages the entire document processing pipeline, from intake to final output.
*   **Knowledge Base and Data Storage**: A secure and scalable repository for storing legal documents, extracted data, and AI-generated insights.

## 3. Component Breakdown

### 3.1. User Interface

The user interface will be a modern, responsive web application designed for ease of use. Key features will include:

*   **Secure Document Upload**: A simple drag-and-drop interface for uploading documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, JPG, PNG).
*   **Dashboard**: A central dashboard providing an overview of document status, recent activity, and key compliance alerts.
*   **Document Viewer and Analysis**: An interactive viewer that displays the original document alongside AI-generated analysis, summaries, and risk assessments.
*   **Workflow Management**: Tools for creating, managing, and tracking document review workflows, similar to the "Matter Information" panel in the Legal on Tech demo.
*   **AI Assistant**: A chat-based interface for users to ask questions about documents and receive instant answers.

### 3.2. Document Intake and OCR Layer

This layer is responsible for preparing documents for AI analysis. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Document Ingestion**: The system accepts documents from the user interface.
2.  **Format Conversion**: Documents are converted to a standard format suitable for OCR processing.
3.  **OCR Processing**: A high-accuracy OCR engine (e.g., Tesseract, AWS Textract, Google Cloud Vision) extracts text from the documents. The choice of OCR engine will depend on the required accuracy and cost considerations.
4.  **Text Cleaning and Structuring**: The extracted text is cleaned to remove noise and structured to preserve the original document layout (e.g., headings, tables, paragraphs).

### 3.3. AI Processing and RAG Layer

This is where the intelligent document analysis takes place. The RAG architecture allows the system to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and use it to generate accurate and context-aware responses.

1.  **Document Chunking and Embedding**: The structured text is divided into smaller chunks, and each chunk is converted into a numerical representation (embedding) using a sentence transformer model.
2.  **Vector Store**: The embeddings are stored in a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone, FAISS) for efficient similarity search.
3.  **Query Processing**: When a user asks a question or initiates an analysis, the query is also converted into an embedding.
4.  **Information Retrieval**: The system searches the vector store for the most relevant document chunks based on the query embedding.
5.  **LLM-Powered Analysis and Generation**: The retrieved chunks are passed to a Large Language Model (LLM) along with the original query. The LLM then generates a comprehensive answer, summary, or analysis.

### 3.4. Workflow Orchestration Layer (Langflow)

Langflow will be used to visually design, build, and manage the entire document processing workflow. The benefits of using Langflow include:

*   **Visual Development**: The drag-and-drop interface allows for rapid prototyping and iteration of workflows.
*   **Modularity**: Each step in the workflow (e.g., OCR, embedding, LLM call) can be a separate component in Langflow, making the system easy to maintain and upgrade.
*   **Flexibility**: Langflow is model-agnostic, allowing for the integration of different OCR engines, embedding models, and LLMs.
*   **Agentic Workflows**: Langflow's support for AI agents enables the creation of sophisticated workflows where different agents can be assigned specific tasks (e.g., a 

contract review agent, a compliance checking agent).

### 3.5. Knowledge Base and Data Storage

This layer is responsible for the secure storage of all data related to the legal assistant.

*   **Document Store**: A secure, cloud-based storage solution (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) will be used to store the original documents.
*   **Metadata Database**: A relational or NoSQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) will store metadata for each document, including its name, upload date, status, and any associated workflow information.
*   **Vector Store**: As mentioned earlier, a dedicated vector database will store the document embeddings for efficient retrieval.

## 4. Technology Stack Summary
