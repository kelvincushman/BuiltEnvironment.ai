- Performance degradation
- Compliance violations

---

## GDPR Compliance

### Right to Access
Users can view all their audit events via the User Activity Dashboard.

### Right to Erasure
Complete audit trail of data deletion requests.

### Right to Portability
Export all user audit events in JSON/CSV format.

### Right to Rectification
Log all data modifications with before/after states.

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Role-based access to audit logs
- Tenant isolation for multi-tenant deployments
- Admin-only access to security events

### Data Protection
- PII hashing/tokenization
- Encrypted storage (AES-256-GCM)
- Secure transmission (TLS 1.3)
- No document content in logs (only metadata)

### Integrity
- Append-only audit logs (immutable)
- Cryptographic signatures for tamper detection
- Regular integrity verification

---

## Performance Optimization

### Write Optimization
- Batch writes (100 events or 5 seconds)
- Async processing (non-blocking)
- Redis buffering for burst handling

### Read Optimization
- TimescaleDB compression (7-day retention in hot storage)
- Elasticsearch indexing for fast search
- Redis caching for recent events
- Materialized views for common queries

---

## Cost Management

### Storage Costs
- Hot storage (expensive, fast): 30-90 days
- Warm storage (medium, compressed): 90 days - 2 years
- Cold archive (cheap, slow): 2-7 years

### Compute Costs
- Async processing reduces API latency
- Batch writes reduce database load
- Caching reduces repeated queries

---

## Troubleshooting

### High Buffer Size
**Symptom**: `buffer_size` in health check is consistently high
**Solution**: Increase `batch_interval` frequency or `batch_size` capacity

### Slow Queries
**Symptom**: Audit queries taking >1 second
**Solution**: Add indexes, check TimescaleDB compression, use Elasticsearch for complex searches

### Missing Events
**Symptom**: Expected audit events not appearing
**Solution**: Check audit logger is started, verify middleware is active, check error logs
