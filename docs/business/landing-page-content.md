## 2. Problem Section (Agitate the Pain)

### Eyebrow
**Why Projects Fall Behind and Budgets Spiral**

### Headline
**The hidden costs of traditional consultancy workflows**

Building services projects are drowning in inefficiency. While technology transforms every other industry, construction consultancy remains stuck in manual processes that create bottlenecks, errors, and delays.

**The reality facing every project stakeholder:**

**Endless design iterations** consume weeks that could be spent on value engineering and optimization.

**Compliance checking delays** create last-minute scrambles when regulations change or documentation gaps emerge.

**Manual documentation** leads to inconsistencies, errors, and rework that inflate costs and extend timelines.

**Reactive problem-solving** means issues surface during construction when they're most expensive to fix.

Every day of delay costs money. Every compliance miss risks project approval. Every manual process is a missed opportunity for optimization.
