**Risk**: Platform scalability issues with high load
- **Mitigation**: Cloud-native architecture, horizontal scaling, load testing, performance monitoring

### Market Risks

**Risk**: Slow enterprise adoption (conservative industry)
- **Mitigation**: Start with small consultancies (innovators), build case studies, gradual enterprise expansion

**Risk**: Regulatory changes make agents outdated
- **Mitigation**: Modular architecture, easy updates, regulation monitoring system, quarterly updates

### Competitive Risks

**Risk**: Large incumbents (Autodesk, Arup) build competing products
- **Mitigation**: First-mover advantage, superior AI, UK specialization, community building

**Risk**: Point solutions (energy modeling, BIM) add AI compliance
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive platform advantage, all 13 disciplines, integrated workflow

### Financial Risks

**Risk**: Burn rate exceeds revenue growth
- **Mitigation**: Conservative hiring, £800K seed for 18-month runway, Series A at £2M ARR milestone

**Risk**: Higher CAC than projected
