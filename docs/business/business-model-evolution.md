## Key Differences

| Aspect | Original (Consultancy) | Current (SaaS) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Business Model** | Do-it-for-you service | Do-it-yourself platform |
| **Revenue** | Per-project fees | Subscription MRR/ARR |

---

## Why the Evolution Makes Sense

### 1. **Broader Market = More Impact**

**Original**: Limited to M&E consultancy services
- Only serve clients we can handle directly
- Compete with other M&E consultancies
- Linear growth limited by hiring engineers

**Current**: Platform serves entire built environment
- Serve **all building disciplines** simultaneously
- Enable existing consultancies to do better work
- Exponential growth through software leverage

### 2. **Better Economics**

**Original Model**:
```
Revenue: £100K project
Costs: 2-3 engineers × 3 months = £50K+
Margin: ~50%
Scale: Must hire to grow
```

**SaaS Model**:
```
Revenue: £499/mo × 400 customers = £199K MRR
Costs: Platform + team (fixed)
Margin: ~80% at scale
Scale: Software scales infinitely
```

### 3. **Your Expertise Still Central**

**Original**: Kelvin & Paul do the engineering work
**Current**: Kelvin & Paul's expertise powers the AI agents

Your M&E knowledge is now **embedded in the platform** and scales to thousands of users!

### 4. **Serve Your Original Customers Better**

**Original**: Property developers hire you to review their projects
**Current**: Property developers **AND their consultancies** subscribe to your platform

You're now a **force multiplier** for the entire industry, not competing with consultancies - you're **empowering them**.

## Updated Revenue Model

### Original (Per-Project):
```
5 projects × £50K = £250K (Year 1)
10 projects × £75K = £750K (Year 2)
15 projects × £100K = £1.5M (Year 3)
```

**Problem**: Must hire engineers to scale, limited by capacity

### Current (SaaS Subscriptions):

**Tier Distribution** (estimated):
- **Starter** (£99/mo): 40% of customers
- **Professional** (£499/mo): 50% of customers ⭐
- **Enterprise** (£1,999/mo): 10% of customers

**Revenue Growth**:
```
Month 6:  50 customers  = £25K MRR  = £300K ARR
Month 12: 100 customers = £50K MRR  = £600K ARR
Month 18: 400 customers = £167K MRR = £2M ARR ✨
```

**Calculation for Month 18**:
- 160 Starter × £99 = £15,840
- 200 Professional × £499 = £99,800
- 40 Enterprise × £1,999 = £79,960
- **Total: £195,600 MRR = £2.35M ARR**

**Advantages**:
- Predictable recurring revenue
- Software scales without hiring proportionally
- Higher margins (80% vs 50%)
- Faster growth potential

## What This Means for Your Journey

### Phase 1: Keep Your M&E Expertise (✅)
Your electrical and mechanical engineering expertise is **MORE valuable** in the SaaS model:
- Powers the AI agents
- Validates outputs
- Provides credibility
- Differentiates from pure tech companies

### Phase 2: Expand Beyond M&E (✅)
The platform covers all disciplines, but you DON'T need to be experts in all:
- Use subject matter experts for other agents
- Partner with chartered engineers
- Leverage AI + regulations data
- Human validation for critical decisions

### Phase 3: Enable, Don't Replace (✅)
You're not competing with M&E consultancies anymore:
- You **enable** them to work faster
- You **enhance** their capabilities
- You become **essential infrastructure**
- Like Salesforce for CRM, you're the platform for built environment compliance

### Phase 4: Scale Beyond Projects (✅)
Original model: 15 projects/year = £1.5M (limited by your time)
SaaS model: 400+ customers = £2M+ (unlimited by software)

---

## Transition Path: How to Get There

### Option A: Dual Model (Hybrid)
**Year 1**: Offer both consultancy AND SaaS
- Use consultancy projects to fund SaaS development
- Convert consultancy clients to platform users
- Gradually shift to pure SaaS

**Revenue Mix**:
- Q1-Q2: 80% consultancy, 20% SaaS
- Q3-Q4: 50% consultancy, 50% SaaS
- Year 2: 20% consultancy, 80% SaaS
- Year 3: 0% consultancy, 100% SaaS

### Option B: Pure SaaS (Recommended)
**Focus entirely on platform**:
- Faster market validation
- Clearer positioning
- No split focus
- True scalability

**Why this is better**:
- Consultancy distracts from product
- Mixed models confuse customers
- SaaS has better economics
- Platform scales infinitely
