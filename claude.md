## Best Practices

### Document Analysis

**DO:**
- Process documents through the document-processor first
- Run multiple checks (compliance, standards, quality)
- Use RAG integration for cross-document queries
- Generate reports for formal deliverables
- Maintain revision control

**DON'T:**
- Skip metadata extraction
- Ignore cross-discipline conflicts
- Rely solely on AI without expert validation
- Process without understanding document context

### Code Development

**DO:**
- Follow multi-tenant architecture patterns
- Ensure data isolation by user ID
- Write comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
- Document complex logic
- Use /review-pr before committing
- Follow security best practices

**DON'T:**
- Hard-code credentials or API keys
- Skip input validation
- Ignore N+1 query issues
- Forget GDPR compliance (data retention, user rights)
- Commit without testing

### Compliance Checking

**DO:**
- Check all applicable regulations (Parts A-S)
- Verify against current standards (not superseded)
- Provide specific regulation references
- Prioritize issues by risk/impact
- Track remediation actions

**DON'T:**
- Make assumptions about building classification
- Skip cross-discipline validation
- Ignore amber/yellow flags
- Forget to cite evidence locations
- Overlook Part L energy requirements

### RAG and Chat Integration

**DO:**
- Use context-aware queries
- Cite sources with page numbers
- Provide confidence scores
- Update RAG database when documents change
- Test retrieval relevance

**DON'T:**
- Assume single source has all answers
- Forget to check for document conflicts
- Ignore low-confidence responses
- Skip relationship mapping between docs

## Integration Points

### Langflow Integration

Commands and skills integrate with Langflow workflows:

**Configuration**: `/docs/implementation/langflow-workflows-specification.md`

**Key Workflows**:
- `document_processing`: OCR, extraction, classification
- `compliance_check`: Multi-agent compliance validation
- `standards_validation`: Standards checking pipeline

**API Integration**:
```python
# Trigger Langflow workflow from skills
langflow_api_url = os.getenv("LANGFLOW_API_URL")
workflow_id = "compliance_check"

response = requests.post(
    f"{langflow_api_url}/workflows/{workflow_id}/run",
    json={"document_id": doc_id, "user_id": user_id}
)
```

### RAG Database Integration

**Vector Database**: ChromaDB (configured in `/init/config.yaml`)

**Integration Flow**:
```
Document â†’ Chunking â†’ Embedding â†’ Indexing â†’ Available for Chat
```

**Query Flow**:
```
User Question â†’ Query Enhancement â†’ Vector Search + Keyword Search
â†’ Reranking â†’ Top-K Results â†’ Response Generation â†’ Source Attribution
```

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Data Isolation**:
- All database queries filtered by `user_id`
- Document storage segregated by tenant
- RAG collections namespaced by tenant
- Complete audit trails

**Security**:
- JWT authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- GDPR compliance (data retention, right to delete)

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Working

**Issue**: Slash command not recognized
```
Solution:
1. Check .claude/commands/ directory exists
2. Verify command file is present (e.g., compliance-check.md)
3. Ensure file has .md extension
4. Check file permissions (should be readable)
```

**Issue**: Command runs but produces errors
```
Solution:
1. Check document path is correct and accessible
2. Verify file format is supported
3. Review command output for specific error messages
4. Check logs for detailed error traces
```

### Skills Not Available

**Issue**: Skill invocation fails
```
Solution:
1. Verify skill file exists in .claude/skills/
2. Check skill definition is complete
3. Ensure dependencies are installed (see init/requirements.txt)
4. Verify API keys in .env file
```

### RAG Integration Issues

**Issue**: Chat not finding relevant documents
```
Solution:
1. Check documents are properly indexed (run rag-integrator)
2. Verify ChromaDB is running and accessible
3. Check embedding model is configured correctly
4. Review chunk size and overlap settings in config.yaml
5. Test with simpler queries to verify basic functionality
```

**Issue**: Low relevance scores
```
Solution:
1. Adjust similarity_threshold in config.yaml (try 0.6 instead of 0.7)
2. Enable reranking for better results
3. Check if query enhancement is working
4. Verify document metadata is properly tagged
```

### Compliance Check Issues

**Issue**: Incorrect compliance status
```
Solution:
1. Verify building classification is correct
2. Check applicable regulations for building type
3. Review document completeness (missing info â†’ RED status)
4. Validate against current regulations (not outdated)
5. Get expert validation for edge cases
```

### Report Generation Issues

**Issue**: Report formatting problems
```
Solution:
1. Check template files are accessible
2. Verify export format is supported
3. Test with simpler report first (executive summary only)
4. Check for special characters in content
5. Ensure sufficient system resources for PDF generation
```
